Here are two database topics that you might have missed:

### 1. **Candidate Key**
- **Definition**: A **candidate key** is a minimal set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple (row) in a relation (table).  
- **Key Points**:
  - A table can have multiple candidate keys.
  - One of the candidate keys is chosen as the **primary key**.
  - Example:  
    Consider a table `Student` with columns `StudentID`, `Email`, and `PhoneNumber`.  
    - Candidate Keys: `{StudentID}`, `{Email}`, `{PhoneNumber}` (assuming all are unique).  
    - Primary Key: `{StudentID}` (chosen for uniqueness).  
- **Why Important?**: Candidate keys help ensure data integrity by preventing duplicate entries.

### 2. **Normalization and Denormalization**
- **Normalization**: The process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.  
  - **Normal Forms**:
    - **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Eliminate duplicate columns and ensure atomic values.
    - **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Ensure all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
    - **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Eliminate transitive dependency.
    - **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: A stricter form of 3NF.  
  - **Example**:
    ```plaintext
    Unnormalized Table:
    Student | Courses
    -----------------
    John    | Math, Science
    
    1NF (Atomic Values):
    Student | Course
    -----------------
    John    | Math
    John    | Science
    ```
  
- **Denormalization**: The process of combining tables to improve read performance, often at the cost of redundancy.  
  - **Use Case**: Optimizing for speed in data retrieval for reporting systems.

### How These Topics Enhance Knowledge
1. **Candidate Key**: Deepens understanding of database schema design and ensures proper indexing for performance.  
2. **Normalization**: Teaches efficient database structure, while **Denormalization** shows trade-offs for real-world applications.
